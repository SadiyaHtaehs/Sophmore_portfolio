<h1>Sadiya Hosein's Portfolio!</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Sadiya Hosein. I like skateboarding, painting skylines and traveling. I like the sound of rain and the sounds of the cars passing by. I love Virginia Beach and the boardwalk and just the energy that's there. 
<p>I am a student at Thomas A. Edison high school and I have future career interests in either the medical field or astrophysics. </p>
<p>I play tennis for my school, and for community service, I help out at a nearby library and organize the books or sometimes I just help out with the little kids. </p>
  
<a href="lesson5_activity.html">Lesson 5 Mini Project</a>
  <p> This mini-project is an activity we comepleted in class where we designed a page for one of multiple people.</p>
  <p>In this case, I chose a baker. The website is organized into sections where the baker has his recipes and his story.</p>
