<h1>Sadiya Hosein's Portfolio!</h1>
  <h2>ðŸ§¸ðŸ§¸ðŸ§¸</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Sadiya Hosein. I like skateboarding, painting skylines and traveling. I like the sound of rain and the sounds of the cars passing by. I love Virginia Beach and the boardwalk and just the energy that's there. 
<br>I am a student at <a href="https://www.taehs.org/">Thomas A Edison. High School,</a> and I have future career interests in either the medical field or astrophysics. 
I play tennis for my school, and for community service, I help out at a nearby library and organize the books or sometimes I just help out with the little kids. </p>

  </p>
  <p> This mini-project is an activity we comepleted in class where we designed a page for one of multiple people.
    <br>
  In this case, I chose a baker. The website is organized into sections where the baker has his recipes and his story.</p>

  <p>Another project we have been working on is creatinga website for various scenarios. I chose to design a website for a person who wants to educate other people about endangered species.</p>
