<h1>Sadiya Hosein's Portfolio!</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Sadiya Hosein. I like skateboarding, painting skylines and traveling. I like the sound of rain and the sounds of the cars passing by. I love Virginia Beach and the boardwalk and just the energy that's there. I am a student at Thomas A. Edison high school and I have future career interests in either the medical field or astrophysics. </p>
